# MultiMC 0.5.2

## Internals

- GH-2026: New Minecraft snapshots are not compatible.

  The temporary solution is blocking of new Minecraft snapshots and versions.

  A future release will add full compatibility.

# Previous releases

## MultiMC 0.5.1

### Improvements

- Log uploads now use HTTPS because the [paste.ee](https://paste.ee) site is switching to HTTPS only.

- Console now has the line limit and overflow settings properly set when hidden.

  Before, if you didn't have the console set to show up on launch, it would have some low default values set.
  This meant that you wouldn't get enough of the log when the game crashed.

- GH-1802: Log resize is now handled properly.

  The log could end up with many empty lines because the wrong maximum size was used during the resize, potentially losing some lines.

- GH-1807: Fixed 'loggging' typo in console overflow notification.

- GH-1801: Launch script is no longer dumped into MultiMC's log on instance launch.

- GH-1065: Use of 'folder' and 'directory' in the UI has been unified to 'folder'.

- GH-1788: A problem with missing translation templates in the setup wizard pages has been fixed.

  It should be possible to translate everything again.

- GH-1789: Deletion of custom icon has been fixed.

  It wasn't possible to do it from the MultiMC icon selection dialog.

- GH-1790: While using the system theme on macOS, dialogs had wrong colors.

  The wrong colors are now only visible immediately after changing the theme to 'System'. An application restart will fix the colors.

  The underlying issue cannot be easily fixed.

  Upstream bug: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-58268

- GH-1793: The Java wizard page did not show up as expected when moving MultiMC between different computers.

  The page should now show up as expected.

- GH-1794: Copied FTB instances did not work properly.

  The instance type of the copy was not set, causing it to not be usable.


## MultiMC 0.5.0

### New or changed features

- GH-338, GH-513, GH-700: Edit instance dialog and Console window have been unified

  The resulting instance window can be closed or reopened at any point, it does not matter if the instance is running or not. The list of available pages in the instance window changes with instance state.

  Multiple instances can now run from the same MultiMC - It's even more **multi** now.

  On launch, the main window is kept open and running instances are marked with a badge. Opening the instance window is no longer the default action. Second activation of a running instance opens the instance window.

  MultiMC can be entirely closed, keeping Minecraft instances running. However, if you close MultiMC, play time tracking, logging and crash reporting will not work.

  Accounts which are in use are marked as such. If you plan to run multiple instances with multiple accounts, it is advisable to not set a default account to make it ask which one to use on launch.

- It is no longer possible to run multiple copies of MultiMC from a single folder

  This generally caused strange configuration and Mojang login issues because the running MultiMC copies did not know about each other.

  With the ability to launch multiple instances with different accounts, it is no longer needed.

  Trying to run a second copy will focus the existing window. If MultiMC was started without a main window, a new main window will be opened. If the second copy is launching an instance from the command line, it will launch in the first copy instead.

  This feature is also used for better checking of correct update completion (GH-1726). It should no longer be possible for MultiMC to end up in a state when it is unable to start - the old version checks that the new one can start and respond to liveness checks by writing a file.

- GH-903: MultiMC now supports theming

  By default, it comes with a Dark, Bright, System (the old default) and Custom theme.

  The Custom theme can change all of the colors, change the Qt widget theme and style the whole UI with CSS rules.
  Files you can customize are created in `themes/custom/`. The CSS theming is similar to what TeamSpeak uses.

  Ultimately, this is a start, not a final solution. If you are interested in making custom themes and would like to shape the direction this takes in the future, ask on Discord. :)

- Translations have been overhauled

  You no longer need to restart MultiMC to change its active translation. MultiMC also asks which translation to use on the first start.

  There is a lot that has to be done with translations, but at least now it should be easier to work with them and use them.

- MultiMC now includes Google Analytics

  The purpose of this is to determine where to focus future effort. Generally, only basic technical information is collected:

  - OS name, version, and architecture
  - Java version, architecture and memory settings
  - MultiMC version
  - System RAM size

  It does not activate until you agree with it. It may be expanded upon later, in which case you will be asked to agree again.

- Java selection on start has been replaced with a more robust solution

  You can select from the list as before, but also provide your own Java and set the basic memory sizes - Heap and PermGen (for java < 8).

  It is checking the configuration and selected Java on the fly and provides more or less instant feedback.

- Java detection has been improved

  MultiMC will prefer looking for `javaw.exe` on Windows and now can scan most, if not all the usual Linux java paths.

- Java memory settings now allow running with less memory

  The minimum has been changed to 128 MB.

- There is now an initial setup wizard

  So far, it is used for selecting the translation to use, the analytics agreement and initial Java setup.

- Existing MCEdit integration has been replaced by the Worlds page in the Instance/Console window

  It supports renaming, copying, and deleting worlds, opening them in MCEdit and copying the world seed without the need to launch Minecraft.

  The Linux version of MCEdit is now also started from the shell script, fixing some compatibility issues.

- GH-767: Minecraft skin upload

  The `Upload Skin` button is located on the Accounts page.

- It is now possible to turn off line wrapping in the Minecraft log
- Groups now have a proper context menu

  You can delete groups and create instances in them using the context menu. Just right click anywhere inside a group that's not an instance.

- Exporting of tracked FTB instances has been disabled

  It did not produce viable instances.

- Added support for Liteloader snapshots

  Requested many times, it's finally available.

- GH-1635, GH-1273, GH-589, GH-842, GH-901, GH-1117: Mod lists have been improved heavily

  - There is filter bar to allow finding mods in large packs quickly.
  - Extended selection is allowed (does not have to be continuous).
  - You can enable and disable many mods at the same time.
  - Sorting by clicking on the column headers is now possible.
  - Mod lists have a column for when a mod was changed last time (or added using the mod list).
  - You can open the `config` folder from the mods list now.

- GH-352: It is now possible to cancel an instance update.

- Instance launch button now has a drop-down arrow instead of click and hold.

  This should make launching with profilers more discoverable.

- When instances do not exit properly (crash), they get a badge

  This should make it easier to spot what crashed if you have multiple running.

- Instances can now contain libraries

  Any libraries stored in `$instanceroot/libraries/` will override the libraries from MultiMC's global folders, as long as they are marked `local` in the JSON patch.

  This should make installing library-based mods easier in the future, and allow to include them in modpacks.

### Improvements

- GH-1433: The account selection dialog no longer shows e-mail addresses when no default account is selected.

  Instead, it shows Minecraft profile names.

- GH-1643: The preferred language property is no longer being censored in logs.

  Because the values are often very short (`en` for example), it was simply not usable.

- GH-1521: JSON editor now works when customized.

- GH-1560: Leading whitespace is now removed from instance names on creation and renaming

  Leading and trailing spaces in names can confuse Windows Explorer and Java.

- GH-1586: MultiMC now prints to command line on Windows, so you can review the command line options.

- GH-1699: Linux builds no longer contain the XCB library

  This caused many compatibility issues on with certain Linux graphics drivers and prevented MultiMC from starting.

- GH-1731: it was possible for the Screenshots page to show a list of all system drives.

  Trying to delete said system drives obviously lead to data loss. Additional checks have been added to prevent this from happening.

- GH-1670: "Instance update failed because: Too soon! Let the LWJGL list load :)." has been fixed.

  This fixes launching of legacy (and legacy FTB) instances.

- GH-1778: Jar modded Minecraft.jar location breaks mod assumptions

  Some ancient mods require the modded `Minecraft.jar` to be in `.minecraft/bin`, inside the instance. Now it is placed there.

### Internals

- Full support for the current Mojang downloads JSON format.

  This includes checksum verification, when available.

- Minecraft logging has been overhauled

  The log now persists after the instance/console window is closed.

- GH-575: Mod lists got a refactor

  The original issue is about adding sub-folder listings to mod lists. However, this is simply a refactor that separates the old Jar mod list from the less complex Loader mods. It allowed all of the mod list improvements to happen.

- The network code has been heavily reworked

  Most issues related to slow networks and failing downloads should be a thing of the past.
  This also includes post-download validation of the download - like using SHA1 checksums.

- Minecraft launching has been reworked

  It is now a lot of tiny reusable tasks that chain together.

  MultiMC now also has a separate launch method that works more like the Mojang launcher (not using a launcher part, but running Java directly).

## MultiMC 0.4.11

This release contains mainly a workaround for Minecraft 1.9 support and returned support for OSX 10.7.

### **IMPORTANT**

- GH-1410: MultiMC crashes on launch on OSX 10.7

  MultiMC didn't work on OSX 10.7 because of an oversight in the build server setup. This has been fixed.

- GH-1453: Minecraft 1.9 snapshots didn't download and launch properly

  This has been caused by a change on Mojang servers - the data is now stored in a different location and the files describing the releases have a different format. The required changes on MultiMC side aren't complete yet, but it's enough to get snapshots working.

  Full support for the new version file format will come in the next release.

- MultiMC version file format was simplified

  Some undocumented and unused features were removed from the format. Mostly version patches that removed libraries, advanced library application, and merging rules, and things of similar nature. If you used them, you used an undocumented feature that is impossible to reach from the UI.

### Improvements

- GH-1502: When the locally cached Minecraft version was deleted, the instance that needed it would have to be started twice

  This was caused by generating the list of launch instructions before the update. It is now fixed.

- Version file issues are now reported in the instance's `Version` page.

  This doesn't apply to every possible issue yet and will be expanded upon in the next release.

## MultiMC 0.4.10

Second hotfix for issues with wifi connections.

### **IMPORTANT**

- GH-1422: Huge ping spikes while using MultiMC

  Another day, another fix. The bearer plugins added in 0.4.9 didn't really help and we ran into more bugs.

  This time, the presence of the network bearer plugins caused a lot of network lag for people on wifi connections.

  Because this wasn't a problem on the previous version of Qt MultiMC used (5.4.2), I ended up reverting to that. This is a temporary solution until the Qt framework can be rebuilt and retested for every platform without this broken feature.

  The upstream bug is [QTBUG-40332](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-40332) and despite being closed, it is far from fixed.

Because of the reverted Qt version, OSX 10.7 *might* work again. If it does, please do tell, it would help with figuring out what went wrong there :)


## MultiMC 0.4.9

Hotfix for issues with wifi connections.

### **IMPORTANT**

- GH-1408: MultiMC 0.4.8 doesn't work on wireless connections.

  This is especially the case on Windows. If you already updated to 0.4.8, you will need to do a manual update, or use a wired connection to do the update.

  The issue was caused by a change in the underlying framework (Qt), and MultiMC not including the network bearer plugins. This made it think that the connection is always down and not try to contact any servers because of that.

  The upstream bug is [QTBUG-49267](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-49267).

- GH-1410: MultiMC crashes on launch on OS X 10.7.5

  OSX 10.7.x is no longer supported by Apple and I do not have a system to test and fix this.

  So, this is likely **NOT** going to be fixed - please update your OS if you are still running 10.7.

### Improvements

- GH-1362: When uploading or copying the Minecraft log, the action is logged, including a full timestamp.

## MultiMC 0.4.8

Fluffy and functional!

### **IMPORTANT**

- GH-1402: MultiMC will keep its binary filename after an update if you rename it.

  Note that this doesn't happen with this (0.4.8) update yet, because the old update method is still used.

  If you renamed `MultiMC.exe` for any reason, you will have to manually remove the renamed file after the update and rename the new `MultiMC.exe`.

  Future updates should no longer have this issue.


### New features

- GH-1047, GH-1233: MultiMC now includes basic Minecraft world management.

  This is a new page in the console/edit instance window.

  You can:
  - Copy worlds
  - Delete worlds
  - Copy the world seed value
  - Run MCEdit - the MCEdit feature has been moved here.

- GH-1217: MultiMC now tracks instance play time and displays it when the instance is selected.

- New buttons on the top toolbar:
  - GH-1238: button for the [MultiMC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiMC/).
  - GH-1397: button for joining the [MultiMC discord voice/chat server](https://discord.gg/0k2zsXGNHs0fE4Wm).

    Both are there for you to interact with other MultiMC users and us.

- GH-253, GH-1300: MultiMC can now be started with the `-l "Instance ID"` parameter, launching the specified instance directly.

### Improvements

- Instance list
  - GH-1121: Instances are now selected after you create them.
  - GH-93: When copying an instance, you can tell MultiMC to not copy the worlds.

- Mod and resource pack lists
  - GH-1237: Mod info is now clickable and selectable.
  - GH-1322: Mod description `...` link will no longer pop up multiple dialogs.
  - GH-1178: When dragged and dropped, folder based mods and resource packs will be copied properly on OSX.

- MCEdit integration:
  - GH-1009: MCEdit Unified on linux is now recognized properly.

- Mojang login and accounts:
  - GH-1158: A unique ID is generated on the MultiMC side before login, instead of letting the server decide.
  - When a password is required, the user login is partially obscured.
  - The dropdown menu on the main window now lists profiles, not accounts.

- Modpacks:
  - GH-1140: Modpack downloads now check for update on the server even if the file is already locally available.
  - GH-1148: When creating an instance from modpack, the instance name will be guessed based on the modpack file or URL (unless you set it yourself).
  - GH-1280: While importing modpacks, the progress dialog now says what is happening.
  - When selecting the modpack field in the new instance dialog, the contents are selected for easy replacement.

- Instance settings
  - Wrapper commands now use the proper UI field and do not get replaced with pre-launch commands.

- Minecraft launching:
  - GH-1053, GH-1338: Minecraft launching has been completely redone.
  - GH-1275: Server resource pack folder is created on launch.
    - This is a workaround for Minecraft bug MCL-3732.
  - GH-1320: Improve compatibility with non-Oracle Java.
  - GH-1355: MMC environment will no longer leak into Minecraft after MultiMC updates itself.

- Minecraft log:
  - Java exception detection in Minecraft logs has been improved.
  - GH-719: You can now use your own [paste.ee](https://paste.ee/) account for uploading logs.
    - New [paste.ee](https://paste.ee/) settings page has been added to the global settings dialog.
  - GH-1197: Text colors in log window now adapt to the background color.
  - GH-1164: The censor filter could be initialized with empty values, leading to unreadable log.
  - GH-1008, GH-1046, GH-1067: Log size limiting.

    The log window now has a configurable limit for the number of lines remembered. You can also specify whether it stops logging or forgets on the fly once the limit is breached.

    This prevents the MultiMC log window from using too much memory on logging. The default limit is 100000 lines and the logging stops.

    Minecraft logging this much is a sign of a problem that needs to be fixed. Any complaints should be addressed to the responsible mod authors.

- Screenshot upload
  - GH-1339: While uploading screenshots, the console window will not close (prevents a crash).

- Other logs:
  - GH-926: 'Other Logs' now has a button for removing all log files.
  - Hidden log files are shown in 'Other logs'.

- User skins:
  - MultiMC now uses [crafatar.com](https://crafatar.com/) for skin downloads instead of the Mojang servers.

- Java:
  - GH-1365: MultiMC now supports Java 9 and its new version numbering.
  - GH-1262: Java can now be placed in a folder relative to MultiMC's folder. This allows bundling of JREs with MultiMC.

- Translations:
  - GH-1313: Some parts of the MultiMC user interface have been marked as 'not for translation'.

### Internals and internal bug fixes

- GH-1052: All the dependencies were rebuilt and the build environment upgraded to the latest compiler versions.
- GH-1051: The CDPATH environment variable is now ignored.
- GH-77, GH-1059, GH-1060: The MultiMC updater is no longer used or necessary.

  It is only present to preserve compatibility with previous versions.
  Updates now work properly on Windows systems when you have Unicode (like ❄, Ǣ or Ω) characters in the path.

- GH-1069, GH-1100: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LD_PRELOAD` environment variables supplied to MultiMC now don't affect MultiMC but affect the launched game.

  This means you can use something like the Steam overlay in MultiMC instances on Linux.
  If you need to use these variables for MultiMC itself, you can use `MMC_LIBRARY_PATH` and `MMC_PRELOAD` instead.

- GH-1389: External processes (like folder views, editors, etc.) are now started in a way that prevents the MultiMC environment to be reused by them.
- GH-1355: If `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` contains any of MultiMC's internal folders, this will not propagate to started processes.
- GH-1231, GH-1378: libpng is now included with the Linux version of MultiMC
- GH-1202: SSL certificates are now rebuilt on start on OSX.

- GH-1303: Translations and notification cache are stored in the normal data folder now, not alongside the binaries. This only affects third party Linux packaging.
- GH-1266, GH-1301: Linux runner scripts has been improved.
- GH-1360: Development and other unstable versions of MultiMC now uses GitHub commits instead of this manually maintained changelog.

## MultiMC 0.4.7

This is what 0.4.6 should have been. Oh well, at least it's here now!

### Functional changes
- GH-974: A copy of the libstdc++ library is now included in Linux releases, improving compatibility
- GH-985: Jar mods are now movable and removable after adding
- GH-983: Use `minecraft.jar` as the main jar when using jar mods - fixes NEI in Legacy Minecraft versions
- GH-977: Fix FTB paths on Windows

   This removes some very old compatibility code. If you get any issues, make sure you run the FTB Launcher and let it update its files.
- GH-992 and GH-1003: Improved performance when saving settings:
  - Bad performance was caused by improved data consistency
  - Each config file is now saved only once, not once for every setting
  - When loading FTB instances, there are no writes to config files anymore
- GH-991: Implemented wrapper command functionality:

  There is an extra field in the MultiMC Java settings that allows running Java inside a wrapper program or script. This means you can run Minecraft with wrappers like `optirun` and get better performance with hybrid graphics on Linux without workarounds.
- GH-997: Fixed saving of multi-line settings. This fixes notes.
- GH-967: It is now possible to add patches (Forge and LiteLoader) to tracked FTB instances properly.

  Libraries added by the patches will be taken from MultiMC's `libraries` folder, while the tracked patches will use FTB's folders.

- GH-1011 and GH-1015: Fixed various issues when the patch versions aren't complete

  This applies when Minecraft versions are missing or when patches are broken and the profile is manipulated by adding, moving, removing, customizing and reverting patches.

- GH-1021: Built in legacy Minecraft versions aren't customizable anymore

   The internal format for Legacy Minecraft versions does not translate to the external patch format and would cause crashes
- GH-1016: MultiMC prints a list of mods, core mods (contents of the core mods folder) and jar mods to the log on instance start. This should help with troubleshooting.
- GH-1031: Icons are exported and imported along with instances

    This only applies if the icon was custom (not built-in) when exporting and the user doesn't choose an icon while importing the pack.

### UI changes
- GH-970: Fixed help button for the External tools and Accounts dialog pages not linking to the proper wiki places
  - Same for the Versions dialog page

- GH-994: Rearranged the buttons on the Versions page to make jar mods less prominent

  Using the `Add jar mods` button will also show a nag dialog until it's been used successfully

## MultiMC 0.4.6

Long time coming, this release brought a lot of incremental improvements and fixes.

### Functional changes
- Old version.json and custom.json version files will be transformed into a Minecraft version patch:
  - The process is automated
  - LWJGL entries are stripped from the original file - you may have to re-do LWJGL version customizations
  - Old files will be renamed - .old extension is added
- It's now possible to:
  - Customize, edit and revert built in version patches (Minecraft, LWJGL)
  - Edit custom version patches (Forge, LiteLoader, other)
- Blocked various environment variables from affecting Minecraft:
  - `JAVA_ARGS`
  - `CLASSPATH`
  - `CONFIGPATH`
  - `JAVA_HOME`
  - `JRE_HOME`
  - `_JAVA_OPTIONS`
  - `JAVA_OPTIONS`
  - `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`
  - If you rely on those in any way, now would be a time to fix that
- Improved handling of LWJGL on OSX (.dylib vs. .jnilib extensions)
- Jar mods are now always put into a generated temporary Minecraft jar instead of being put on the classpath
- PermGen settings:
  - Changed default PermGen value to 128M because of many issues from new users
  - MultiMC now recognizes the Java version used and will not add PermGen settings to Java >= 1.8
- Implemented simple modpack import and export feature:
  - Export allows selecting which files go into the resulting zip archive
  - Only MultiMC instances for now, other pack formats are planned
  - Import is either from local file or URL, URL can't have ad/click/pay gates
- Instance copy doesn't follow symlinks on Linux anymore
  - Still does on Windows because copying symlinks requires Administrator level access
- Instance delete doesn't follow symlinks anymore - anywhere
- MCEdit tool now recognizes MCEdit2.exe as a valid file to runtime
- Log uploads now follow the maximum allowed paste sizes of paste.ee and are encoded properly
- MultiMC now doesn't use a proxy by default
- Running profilers now works on Windows
- MultiMC will warn you if you run it from WinRAR or temporary folders
- Minecraft process ID is printed in the log on start
- SSL certificates are fixed on OSX 10.10.3 and newer - see [explanation](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2911209/mac-os-x/yosemite-10103-breaks-some-applications-and-https-sites.html).
